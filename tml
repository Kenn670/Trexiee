    <p><strong>Happy 3rd monthsary, my love 🤍</strong></p>

    <p>
        Three months might sound short to some people, but to me, it feels like a whole little lifetime of memories,
        emotions, lessons, and love that I never knew I needed this much. In just three months, you’ve become someone
        I look forward to every day, someone who makes my ordinary days feel special, and someone who brings me
        comfort just by being you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love how you make me smile without even trying. I love how your presence feels like home, even when we’re
        not together. You’ve seen my soft moments, my silly side, my quiet thoughts, and even my flaws—and you stayed.
        That alone means more to me than you’ll ever know. Thank you for choosing me, for understanding me, and for
        loving me in your own beautiful way.
    </p>

    <p>
        These past three months taught me what it feels like to care deeply for someone, to be patient, to listen
        more, and to grow—not just as a partner, but as a person. Loving you has been gentle and exciting at the same
        time. You inspire me to be better, to dream more, and to believe that love doesn’t have to be perfect to be
        real.
    </p>

    <p>
        I know we’re still at the beginning of our story, but I’m grateful for every moment we’ve shared so far—every
        laugh, every late-night talk, every small argument we worked through, and every time we chose each other
        again. I’m excited for all the months ahead of us, for the challenges we’ll face hand in hand, and for the
        memories we haven’t made yet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for being my safe place, my happiness, and my favorite person. I’m so lucky to have you, and I hope
        you always feel how much you are loved and appreciated—by me, always.
    </p>

        Happy 3rd monthsary, my love. Here’s to us, and to many more months and memories together 🥺
        <strong>ILOVEYOUUUU ALWAYS AND IMISSYOUU VERY MUCH MY LOVE ❤️</strong>
